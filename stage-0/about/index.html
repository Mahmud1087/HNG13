            Hi, I'm <span class="highlight">Mahmud Abdulazeez</span>, a
            passionate frontend developer with a love for creating beautiful,
            accessible, and user-friendly web experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that great web development is the perfect intersection of
            <strong>clean code</strong>, <strong>intuitive design</strong>, and
            <strong>meaningful user experiences</strong>. Every line of code I
            write is an opportunity to make someone's interaction with
            technology better, more efficient, and more delightful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing
            to open-source projects, and engaging with the developer community
            through blogs and social media.

          <p>Dear Future Mahmud,</p>
          <p>
            If you're reading this after becoming a finalist, I hope you're
            proud of how far you've come. Remember the late nights debugging
            that seemingly impossible error? The moments of frustration when a
            concept just wouldn't click? The imposter syndrome that crept in
            when comparing yourself to others?
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope you pushed through all of that. I hope you asked for help
            when you needed it, celebrated small wins, and never lost sight of
            why you started this journey in the first place.
          </p>
          <ul class="section-list">
            <li>
              Remember: <strong>Progress over perfection.</strong> Every mistake
              was a lesson, every bug was an opportunity to learn something new.
            </li>
            <li>
              Keep building things that matter. The best code you'll ever write
              is code that solves real problems for real people.
            </li>
            <li>
              Never stop learning. Technology evolves rapidly, and so should
              you. But don't forget to rest and recharge.
            </li>
            <li>
              Share what you learn. Teaching others solidifies your own
              understanding and contributes to the community that supported you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Be kind to yourself. You're doing better than you think, even on
              the days when it doesn't feel like it.
            </li>

          Extra Thoughts & Reflections
        </h2>
        <div class="section-content" data-testid="test-about-extra">
          <p>
            <strong>On learning:</strong> I've realized that learning to code
            isn't just about memorizing syntax or following tutorials. It's
            about developing problem-solving skills, learning to break down
            complex problems, and building the resilience to keep trying when
            things don't work.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>On community:</strong> The tech community has been
            incredibly welcoming. From Stack Overflow answers to Twitter threads
            to supportive Discord servers, I'm constantly amazed by how willing
            people are to help others learn and grow.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>On imposter syndrome:</strong> It's real, and it's
            challenging. But I'm learning that everyone experiences it,
            regardless of their skill level. The key is not to let it paralyze
            youâ€”use it as motivation to learn and improve.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>On the journey ahead:</strong> I know there will be
            challenges. There will be moments of doubt, frustration, and
            exhaustion. But I also know there will be breakthroughs, "aha!"
            moments, and the incredible satisfaction of building something from
            nothing. I'm ready for all of it.
